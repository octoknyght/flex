    02. flex-1 (display:flex)
      a. add a class of flex-1 to both #cover and #details
        - this allows flex items (#cover and #details) to grow and shrink as needed, ignoring their initial size
        - since there are 2 flex items, they will now share the parent's height and width (#banner) giving them 50% each
      b. add a background color of blue-100 to cover and red-100 to details
        - TIP 1: using lighter colors are better when experimenting since they're easier on the eyes
        - TIP 2: using background colors are better than borders since border sizes affects the element's size
    
    Don't forget to run 
    'npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css' or
    'npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch'
