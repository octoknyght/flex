    03. More Flexes ðŸ’ª
      #You didn't see any changes on the last exercise since we didn't set any width and height for the #left and #right elements
      #We'll use flex for that so they can occupy their parent's size, and responsively grow and shrink as needed

      a. add flex class to #details
        - like the #banner, this will allow #details to have its own flex items
      b. add flex-1 to both #left and #right
        - they now share the #details width and height
      c. add flex-col to #details
        - this will now correctly stack elements vertically, 
          following the layout we wanted on tiny mobile screens
        - but this also displays on larger screens so let's handle that next
      d. add sm:flex-row 
        - this will now stack elements horizontally on sm, md, lg, xl, ...
